MonSter-plusplus Model License v1.0, Release Date: October 20, 2025

"Agreement" means the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
distribution, and modification of the Monster-plusplus Materials set
forth herein.

"Monster-plusplus Materials" means, collectively, the stereo vision
and depth estimation models, trained model weights, algorithms, and
documentation distributed under this Agreement. The Monster-plusplus
models were trained using publicly available datasets (including but not
limited to KITTI, Middlebury, ETH3D, TartanAir, etc.) that are subject
to their respective research-only or non-commercial licenses.

"Licensors" means Autel Robotics Co., Ltd. and Huazhong University
of Science and Technology, who jointly release the Monster-plusplus
Materials under this Agreement but do not claim ownership of the
underlying datasets used for model training.

"Licensee" or "you" means any individual or entity accessing,
using, reproducing, or distributing the Monster-plusplus Materials under
this Agreement.

By accessing or using any portion of the Monster-plusplus Materials, you
agree to be bound by this Agreement.

1. License Rights and Redistribution.

a. Grant of Rights.

You are granted a non-exclusive, worldwide, non-transferable, and

or other rights to the extent such rights exist embodied in the
Monster-plusplus Materials to use, reproduce, and modify the
Monster-plusplus Materials solely for non-commercial research and
educational purposes. Redistribution is permitted only within academic
or research contexts under the same terms. The trained model weights
incorporate information derived from third-party research-only datasets
and must not be used or redistributed for any commercial or
safety-critical application.

Any commercial use, redistribution, or offering of services based on the
Monster-plusplus Materials or derivatives thereof is prohibited unless
expressly authorized in writing by the Licensors.

i. If you distribute or make the Monster-plusplus Materials, or any
derivative works thereof, available to a third party, you shall provide
a copy of this Agreement to such third party.

ii. You must retain in all copies the following attribution notice:
"Monster-plusplus model is licensed under the Monster-plusplus Model
License, Copyright © Autel Robotics Co., Ltd. and Huazhong University of
Science and Technology. All Rights Reserved."

iii. The Monster-plusplus Materials and any derivative works thereof
shall not be used for any commercial purpose, including but not limited
to applications in autonomous vehicles, drones, robotics, surveillance,
or other safety-critical systems, nor for any military or
law-enforcement purpose.

iv. Your use of the Monster-plusplus Materials must comply with all
applicable laws and export control regulations.

v. The Monster-plusplus Materials shall not be used for any activity
that may endanger national security, harm public interests, or infringe

(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
Monster-plusplus Materials or Monster-plusplus outputs or results, or
any portion thereof, infringe any intellectual property or other rights
owned or licensable by you, then any licenses granted to you under this
Agreement shall automatically terminate as of the date such litigation
or claim is filed or instituted. You will indemnify and hold harmless
the Licensors from and against any claim, loss, or liability by any
third party arising out of or related to your use or distribution of the
Monster-plusplus Materials. The Licensors make no representation or
warranty regarding the rights of third parties in any datasets used for
model training.

d. Data Sources and Third-Party Rights.

The Monster-plusplus model was trained using publicly available datasets
(including but not limited to KITTI, ETH3D, Middlebury, TartanAir, etc.)
that are restricted to non-commercial research use. Licensees must
comply with the applicable non-commercial terms and any other
restrictions of those datasets. The Licensors acknowledge that certain
datasets used in training the Monster-plusplus model may themselves
contain third-party data governed by additional terms. Licensees are
responsible for ensuring compliance with any such upstream requirements.

6. Term and Termination.
